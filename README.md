# Customer-API

1)	Create a Restful API service using SpringBoot.
a.	The purpose of this service is to get customer information and return customer information when requested as well as inserting new customer information.
b.	This customer API will have two endpoints
i.	Endpoint 1 will be a GET which will take a customer’s first name in the URL and return a JSON response with any customer that has that first name along with the last name, date of birth, and address.
ii.	Endpoint 2 will be a POST which will take a customer’s first and last name, date of birth, and address and place that in the database (Java comes with a bundled database you can use locally but maybe there will be a better local database you can use instead)
2)	This application, once working locally, needs to be deployed on an AWS server so that it is exposed to the world to use.
Tips:
Make sure to have:
1)	intellij downloaded
2)	Github repo cloned to your desktop
3)	Research creating a restful API using Spring Boot project
